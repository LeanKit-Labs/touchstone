Welcome to the LeanKit style guide. This repo is evolving quickly - expect change (especially as we add new bits/tools).

We've spent a good deal of time reviewing various portions of our code base in depth. We've come away with a set of core principles which, if we adhere to them, can help alleviate any unnecessary cognitive overhead.

Our current goals/objectives:

* Establish a consistent approach to formatting
* Automate linting and formatting as much as humanly possible
* Commits/PRs from here on need to adhere to these guidelines (this include old code that is revisited/refactored, etc.)

PLEASE see the [wiki](https://github.com/LeanKit-Labs/touchstone/wiki) - that's where the real information is on how to use the files in this repo.
